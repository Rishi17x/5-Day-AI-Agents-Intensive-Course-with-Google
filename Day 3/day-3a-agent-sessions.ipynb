This is a truly impactful area where AI is making a significant difference. Let me elaborate:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore diving deeper, it's essential to understand what a drug target is. In essence, a drug target is a specific molecule within the body (usually a protein or gene) that plays a crucial role in a disease process. By designing a drug that can interact with this target (e.g., by blocking its activity, activating it, or altering its function), we aim to treat or prevent the disease.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying drug targets has been a laborious and often serendipitous process. It involved years of research, hypothesis-driven experimentation, and a deep understanding of known biological pathways. AI is changing this paradigm by:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Massive, Multi-Omics Datasets:**\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can sift through billions of genetic sequences to identify genes that are upregulated or downregulated in diseased cells compared to healthy cells. This can point to genes whose protein products are involved in the disease.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze the proteins present in cells or tissues, identifying changes in protein abundance, modifications, or interactions that are linked to disease.\n    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI can analyze RNA molecules, which are the intermediaries between genes and proteins, to understand gene expression patterns.\n    *   **Metabolomics:** AI can study the small molecules (metabolites) involved in cellular processes, revealing metabolic disruptions associated with disease.\n    *   **Single-Cell Data:** AI is crucial for analyzing complex single-cell data, allowing researchers to understand cell-to-cell variability and identify targets specific to certain cell types within a diseased tissue.\n\n2.  **Uncovering Hidden Patterns and Relationships:**\n    *   **Network Analysis:** AI can build complex biological networks, mapping out how different genes, proteins, and pathways interact. By analyzing these networks, AI can identify \"bottleneck\" nodes or critical hubs that, if targeted, could have a significant impact on the disease.\n    *   **Identifying Non-Obvious Connections:** Diseases are often complex and multifactorial. AI can find subtle correlations between seemingly unrelated biological factors that humans might miss, leading to novel hypotheses about disease mechanisms and potential targets.\n\n3.  **Predicting Disease Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Causal Inference:** Advanced AI techniques are being developed to go beyond correlation and infer causation – to understand which biological events are actually *causing* the disease, rather than just being associated with it.\n    *   **Simulating Biological Processes:** AI can build computational models that simulate how biological systems behave, allowing researchers to test hypotheses about disease progression and identify key intervention points.\n\n**How AI is Enhancing Target Validation:**\n\nOnce a potential target is identified, it needs to be \"validated\" – meaning researchers need strong evidence that targeting this molecule will actually lead to a therapeutic benefit and is safe. AI is helping with validation by:\n\n1.  **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n    *   **Structure-Based Prediction:** AI can analyze the 3D structure of a target protein and predict whether it has a \"pocket\" or site where a drug molecule can bind effectively.\n    *   **Property Prediction:** AI models can predict the likelihood of successful binding and downstream effects of a potential drug on the target, based on its chemical and biological properties.\n\n2.  **Leveraging Existing Literature and Databases:**\n    *   **Knowledge Graphs:** AI can build comprehensive knowledge graphs that link scientific literature, experimental data, and clinical trial information. This allows AI to rapidly assess existing evidence for a target's role in a disease and its potential for therapeutic intervention.\n    *   **Prioritization:** By analyzing the wealth of available data, AI can help prioritize which identified targets are most likely to be successful, saving researchers time and resources.\n\n3.  **In Silico (Computational) Experimentation:**\n    *   **Virtual Screening Enhancements:** While AI for screening was mentioned earlier, it also plays a role in validation by simulating how potential drugs interact with the target in a virtual environment.\n    *   **Predicting Off-Target Effects:** AI can help predict if targeting a specific molecule might also affect other, unintended molecules in the body, which could lead to side effects.\n\n**Real-World Impact:**\n\n*   **Faster identification of novel targets:** This significantly shortens the early stages of drug discovery.\n*   **Reduced R&D costs:** By focusing on more promising targets and reducing the number of failed experiments.\n*   **Opening up new therapeutic avenues:** AI can identify targets for diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable.\"\n*   **Enabling precision medicine:** By identifying targets that are specific to certain patient subgroups.\n\nIn essence, AI is acting as an incredibly powerful assistant to biologists and pharmacologists, empowering them to navigate the immense complexity of biological systems and pinpoint the most promising levers for treating disease. It's shifting drug discovery from a process of \"trial and error\" to one of more informed and predictive design.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies driving the advancements in **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation** using AI.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
